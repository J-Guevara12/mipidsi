# mipidsi

This repository provides generic display drivers to connect to TFT displays
that implement the [MIPI Display Command Set](https://www.mipi.org/specifications/display-command-set).

It consists of

* [mipidsi](mipidsi) - sync version of the driver
* [mipidsi-async](mipidsi-async) - async version of the driver

*NOTES*:

* The name of these crates is a bit unfortunate as the drivers work with displays that use the MIPI Display Command Set but MIPI Display Serial Interface is NOT supported at this time.
